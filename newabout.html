                Hello World! I am academically trained accountant metamorphosing into a software engineer.
                I have been working in tech for 8 years in various roles within software engineering.
                For the past 7 years I have been working with the Department of Finance for
                the City of New York in functional, performance and datawarehouse testing and production support.

                I have always been fascinated with the role of a software engineer, particularly the role of women
                software engineers and the lack of them in the workplace.So, I decided to be one!

                To acheive this goal, I decided to complete my graduate program in software
                development from Boston University along with a graduate certificate in Web Application Development.
                Equipped with my degree and years of experience in the tech world, I hope to begin my journey as a Web
                developer focusing primarily on backend technologies and learning towards a full stack role.
