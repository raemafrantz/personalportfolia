            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p id=first-section>
                Hello World! I am academically trained accountant metamorphosing into a software engineer.
                I have been working in tech for 8 years in various roles within software engineering. I started my
                career as a software tester consultant which helped me understand the end to end software development
                lifecycle,specifically the test life cycle,the intricacies of functional and GUI testing and solidify my
                interest in
                software engineering. For the past 7 years I have been working with the Department of Finance for
                the City of New York in functional, performance and datawarehouse testing and production support.

                I have always been fascinated with the role of a software engineer, particularly the role of women
                software engineers and the lack of them in the workplace.So, I decided to be one!</br>
                </br>
                To acheive this goal, I decided to complete my graduate program in software
                development from Boston University along with a graduate certificate in Web Application Development.
                Equipped with my degree and years of experience in the tech world, I hope to begin my journey as a Web
                developer focusing primarily on backend technologies and learning towards a full stack role.
